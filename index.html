      <p>This statement has been updated to clarify information on community based applications to the Yukon Nominee Program

        Premier and Minister of Economic Development Ranj Pillai has issued the following statement:
        
        “Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has informed the Government of Yukon that the territory will receive a nominee allocation of 215 for 2025. This is a 50 per cent reduction from 2024 levels.
        
        “The Yukon Nominee Program (YNP) was scheduled to reopen for applications from all employers on January 29, 2025, at 9 am Yukon Time. 
        
        “Following notification of the nominee allocation for this year, which we received on January 15, the Department of Economic Development held an initial meeting with industry organizations to gather their input on how to proceed as quickly as possible.
        
        “In consideration of these discussions with industry organizations, the timing of IRCC’s announcement relative to our planned intake and the scale of the reduction, we have made the decision to delay the planned January intake. This is to allow more time to further consider the program’s approach to accepting and processing applications in 2025, to ensure this limited allocation is used strategically to address the Yukon’s pressing labour market needs.
        
        “We will be considering how to implement a new requirement from IRCC that at least 75 per cent of all nominations are from temporary residents already within Canada.
        
        “This change also means that the program will no longer accept applications from employers in rural communities after January 22 at 4:30 pm Yukon Time. Applications from Whitehorse and community-based employers will both be accepted when we resume intake.
        
        “We are committed to providing further details at the earliest opportunity, and we will continue to advocate to IRCC to address the needs of Yukoners.”</p>
